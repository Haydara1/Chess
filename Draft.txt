# Solving the pawn movement displaying problem:

The clicked pawn:
00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_01000000_00000000
The Displayed movements:
00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000010_00000010_00000000_00000000
The correct movement:
00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_01000000_01000000_00000000_00000000

After the displaying test, aparently the pawn position that I am getting is wrong.
Time to fix that.

problem fixed.

- So now the board class has the bitboard and the mailbox representation methods.
The mailbox will be useful for making movements.
The bitboard is useful for calculating those movements.

- Now I need to understand the Least significant one and the most significant one to be 
able to code the logic for the sliding pieces movements.

# Explication
	In computing, the least significant bit (LSb) is the bit position in a binary integer representing the binary 1s place of the integer. 
	Similarly, the most significant bit (MSb) represents the highest-order place of the binary integer. 
	The LSb is sometimes referred to as the low-order bit or right-most bit,
	due to the convention in positional notation of writing less significant digits further to the right.
	The MSb is similarly referred to as the high-order bit or left-most bit. In both cases, 
	the LSb and MSb correlate directly to the least significant digit and most significant digit of a decimal integer.

I finished writing the code for the movements, now time to write it for the eating.
