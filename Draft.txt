# Solving the pawn movement displaying problem:

The clicked pawn:
00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_01000000_00000000
The Displayed movements:
00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000010_00000010_00000000_00000000
The correct movement:
00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_01000000_01000000_00000000_00000000

After the displaying test, aparently the pawn position that I am getting is wrong.
Time to fix that.

problem fixed.

- So now the board class has the bitboard and the mailbox representation methods.
The mailbox will be useful for making movements.
The bitboard is useful for calculating those movements.
